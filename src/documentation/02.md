Running Countdown
=================

## With a file input

Assuming you have some example file under ~/input/test containing
the text '15 6 4 2 3', you could run

```
  docker run -v ~/input/:/foo porpoiseltd/ga /foo/test
```

## With the example packaged input

There is a 'simple.example' file in the image, so you could just run:

```
  docker run porpoiseltd/ga /examples/simple.example
```


## With user input

You can also just specify the numeric inputs directly,
the first number being the target number:

```
  docker run porpoiseltd/ga 1 2 3 4 5
```

Which would produce output like:

```
