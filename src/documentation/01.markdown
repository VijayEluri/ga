Building the Project
====================

The library was intended to be a general purpose one, but it does
include an example 'Countdown' application which works out a target
number given some other input numbers.

When first written, I misunderstood the problem, however, and thought
you had to use all the numbers. Oh well... It still works, just with
that slightly differently interpreted problem space.

## Build

To build the executable docker image:

```scala
  sbt docker
```

Which will produce a porpoiseltd/ga image


To build and check this site content:

```scala
  sbt makeSite
```

or

```scala
  sbt previewSite
```
